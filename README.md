<h1>How did I do it? I wonder</h1>

<p> One of the challenges that I've faced wast to find the "perfrect" nav bar to go along my previous design. It was pointless for me to even try since almost every attempt I made was a faliure, so I got this idea of editing myself the bootstrap code and make it fit in both versions... It was a pain in the head as well the color palette I used since I did not have the hex codes for the colors, moreover, it was difficut to change bootstrap's code to match yout design.</p> <br><br>11
<p> I had also attempted to replicate de video post I had in my other assignment and I could not do it, the code had several complicated lines I just decided to leave it...</p> :nerd_face:
